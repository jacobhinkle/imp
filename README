Imp: simple scientific data storage

Imp tries to solve a simple problem: you have applications and
scripts, written in different languages, which run for a while, and
which generate interesting data during the course of the
execution. Imp lets you publish this data and stores it for you, so it
can be later retrieved. You can use to debug your program, to compare
different runs, or simply to avoid losing that output file, once
again. 

Imp offers a few advantages. If you want to write a visualization
front-end, it only needs to speak imp, and can be easily separated
from your processing script. It also transparently provides archival,
so the data for that figure you generated three months ago? Don't
worry: imp still remembers it.
