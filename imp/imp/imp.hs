-- publisher account. holds info about the publisher, and a list of their shares
data PublisherAcct = PublisherAcct { shares :: Map.Map String Share }

-- this holds info about currently connected clients who are watching
-- published shares for updates.  watched shares will send push
-- notifications to these clients whenever a share is updated.
-- TODO: This is not the right data structure for this.  Instead, we need a
-- structure that we links Shares to Clients but is also cleaned up easily
-- when a client disconnects
data SubscriberAcct = SubscriberAcct { subbedShares :: [Share] }

-- this can hold info about connected clients
